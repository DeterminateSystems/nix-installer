**Determinate Nix Installer** is the easiest and most reliable way to install [Nix]&mdash;as well as our longest-running project.

When we created Determinate Nix, we added support for it directly into the installer via the `--determinate` flag.

The installer works across a wide range of environments, including macOS, Linux, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), SELinux, the Valve Steam Deck, and more.
It can install either [Nix](https://nixos.org) or [Determinate Nix][det-nix] (with [flakes] enabled by default), it offers support for seamlessly [uninstalling Nix](#uninstalling), it enables Nix to survive [macOS upgrades][macos-upgrades], and [much more](#features).

The quickest way to have a great Nix experience is with [Determinate Nix][det-nix].
This one liner will do just that on any supported system:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install --determinate
```

If you'd prefer upstream Nix:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

> [!TIP]
> The **best way to get Determinate Nix on macOS** is with the <a href="https://install.determinate.systems/determinate-pkg/stable/Universal">macOS package</a>.

Determinate Nix Installer successfully completes **tens of thousands** of installs every day in a number of environments, including [Github Actions](#as-a-github-action) and [GitLab](#on-gitlab):

| Platform                                                             |    Multi user?    | `root` only |     Maturity      |

### As a Github Action

You can install Determinate Nix on [GitHub Actions][actions] using [`determinate-nix-action`][determinate-nix-action].
Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@v3
      - name: Run `nix build`
        run: nix build .
```

If you would rather use upstream Nix, use [`nix-installer-action`][nix-installer-action]:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main
```

#### Pinning the GitHub Action

The [determinate-nix-action] is updated and tagged for every Determinate release.
For example, `DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@v3.5.2` will always install Determinate Nix v3.5.2.

Additionally, an extra tag on the major version is kept up to date with the current release.
The `DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@v3` reference, for example, installs the most recent release in the `v3.x.y` series.

### Planners

Determinate Nix Installer installs Nix by following a _plan_ made by a _planner_.
To review the available planners:

```shell
/nix/nix-installer install --help
```

Planners have their own options and defaults, sharing most of them in common.
To see the options for Linux, for example:

```shell
/nix/nix-installer install linux --help
```

You can configure planners using environment variables or command arguments:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
  NIX_BUILD_GROUP_NAME=nixbuilder sh -s -- install --nix-build-group-id 4000

# Alternatively:

NIX_BUILD_GROUP_NAME=nixbuilder ./nix-installer install --nix-build-group-id 4000
```

See [Installer settings](#installer-settings) below for a full list of options.

### Troubleshooting

Having problems with the installer?
Consult our [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) to see if your problem is covered.

### Upgrading Nix

If you've installed [Determinate Nix][det-nix], you can upgrade it using [Determinate Nixd][dnixd]:

```shell
sudo determinate-nixd upgrade
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not sure if you're using Determinate Nix?
> Run `nix --version` and if you see a version like `nix (Determinate Nix 3.4.1) 2.28.2` then you're running Determinate Nix.

If you've installed [upstream Nix][upstream-nix], you can upgrade it by running:

```shell
sudo -i nix upgrade-nix
```

Alternatively, you can [uninstall](#uninstalling) and [reinstall](#install-nix) with a different version of Determinate Nix Installer.

### Uninstalling

You can remove Nix installed by Determinate Nix Installer by running:

```shell
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

### On GitLab

[GitLab CI][gitlab-ci] runners are typically [Docker] based and run as the `root` user.
This means that `systemd` is not present, so you need to pass the `--init none` option to the Linux planner.

On the default [GitLab] runners, you can install Nix using this configuration:

```yaml
test:
  script:
    - curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install linux --no-confirm --init none
    - . /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh
    - nix run nixpkgs#hello
    - nix profile install nixpkgs#hello
    - hello
```

If you are using different runners, the above example may need to be adjusted.

### Without systemd (Linux only)

> [!WARNING]
> When `--init none` is used, _only_ `root` or users who can elevate to `root` privileges can run Nix:
>
> ```shell
> sudo -i nix run nixpkgs#hello
> ```

If you don't use [systemd], you can still install Nix by explicitly specifying the `linux` plan and `--init none`:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
  sh -s -- install linux --init none
```

### In a container

In [Docker]/[Podman] containers or [WSL2][wsl] instances where an init (like `systemd`) is not present, pass `--init none`.

For containers (without an init):

> [!WARNING]
> When `--init none` is used, _only_ `root` or users who can elevate to `root` privileges can run Nix:
>
> ```shell
> sudo -i nix run nixpkgs#hello
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to add a `flake.nix`, first declare a working directory (such as `/src`) in your `Dockerfile`.
> You cannot lock a flake placed at the docker image root (`/`) ([see details](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/issues/1066)).
> You would get a `file '/dev/full' has an unsupported type` during the docker build.
>
> ```dockerfile
> # append this to the below dockerfiles
> WORKDIR /src
> # now flakes will work
> RUN nix flake init
> RUN nix flake lock
> ```

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt update -y
RUN apt install curl -y
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install linux \
  --extra-conf "sandbox = false" \
  --init none \
  --no-confirm
ENV PATH="${PATH}:/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin"
RUN nix run nixpkgs#hello
```

```shell
docker build -t ubuntu-with-nix .
docker run --rm -ti ubuntu-with-nix
docker rmi ubuntu-with-nix
# or
podman build -t ubuntu-with-nix .
podman run --rm -ti ubuntu-with-nix
podman rmi ubuntu-with-nix
```

For containers with a [systemd] init:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt update -y
RUN apt install curl systemd -y
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install linux \
  --extra-conf "sandbox = false" \
  --no-start-daemon \
  --no-confirm
ENV PATH="${PATH}:/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin"
RUN nix run nixpkgs#hello
CMD [ "/bin/systemd" ]
```

```shell
podman build -t ubuntu-systemd-with-nix .
IMAGE=$(podman create ubuntu-systemd-with-nix)
CONTAINER=$(podman start $IMAGE)
podman exec -ti $CONTAINER /bin/bash
podman rm -f $CONTAINER
podman rmi $IMAGE
```

With some container tools, such as [Docker], you can omit `sandbox = false`.
Omitting this will negatively impact compatibility with container tools like [Podman].

### In WSL2

We **strongly recommend** first [enabling systemd][enabling-systemd] and then installing Nix as normal:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
  sh -s -- install
```

If [WSLg][wslg] is enabled, you can do things like open a Linux Firefox from Windows on Powershell:

```powershell
wsl nix run nixpkgs#firefox
```

To use some OpenGL applications, you can use [`nixGL`][nixgl] (note that some applications, such as `blender`, may not work):

```powershell
wsl nix run --impure github:guibou/nixGL nix run nixpkgs#obs-studio
```

If enabling systemd is not an option, pass `--init none` at the end of the command:

> [!WARNING]
> When `--init none` is used, _only_ `root` or users who can elevate to `root` privileges can run Nix:
>
> ```shell
> sudo -i nix run nixpkgs#hello
> ```

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
  sh -s -- install linux --init none
```

### Skip confirmation

If you'd like to bypass the confirmation step, you can apply the `--no-confirm` flag:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | \
  sh -s -- install --no-confirm
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're looking for Determinate Nix, make sure to pass `--determinate` at the same time.

This is especially useful when using the installer in non-interactive scripts.

## Features

Existing Nix installation scripts do a good job but they are difficult to maintain.

Subtle differences in the shell implementations and tool used in the scripts make it difficult to make meaningful changes to the installer.

Determinate Nix installer has numerous advantages over these options:

- It installs Nix with [flakes] enabled by default
- It enables Nix to [survive macOS upgrades][survival-mode]
- It keeps an installation _receipt_ for easy [uninstallation](#uninstalling)
- It uses [planners](#planners) to create appropriate install plans for complicated targets&mdash;plans that you can review prior to installation
- It enables you to perform a best-effort reversion in the facing of a failed install
- It improves installation performance by maximizing parallel operations
- It supports an expanded test suite including "curing" cases (compatibility with Nix already on the system)
- It supports SELinux and OSTree-based distributions without asking users to make compromises
- It operates as a single, static binary with external dependencies such as [OpenSSL], only calling existing system tools (like `useradd`) when necessary
- As a macOS remote build target, it ensures that Nix is present on the `PATH`

## Nix community involvement

It has been wonderful to collaborate with other participants in the [Nix Installer Working Group][wg] and members of the broader community.
The working group maintains a [foundation-owned fork of the installer][forked-installer].

## Quirks

While Determinate Nix Installer tries to provide a comprehensive and unquirky experience, there are unfortunately some issues that may require manual intervention or operator choices.
See [this document](./docs/quirks.md) for information on resolving these issues:

- [Using MacOS after removing Nix while nix-darwin was still installed, network requests fail](./docs/quirks.md#using-macos-after-removing-nix-while-nix-darwin-was-still-installed-network-requests-fail)

## Building a binary

See [this guide](./docs/building.md) for instructions on building and distributing the installer yourself.

## As a Rust library

The Determinate Nix Installer is available as a standard [Rust] library.
See [this guide](./docs/rust-library.md) for instructions on using the library in your own Rust code.

## Accessing other versions

You can pin to a specific version of Determinate Nix Installer by modifying the download URL.
Here's an example:

```shell
VERSION="v0.6.0"
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix/tag/${VERSION} | \
  sh -s -- install
```

To discover which versions are available, or download the binaries for any release, check the [Github Releases][releases].

Each installer version has an [associated supported nix version](src/settings.rs)&mdash;if you pin the installer version, you'll also indirectly pin to the associated nix version.

You can also override the Nix version using `--nix-package-url` or `NIX_INSTALLER_NIX_PACKAGE_URL=` but doing this is not recommended since we haven't tested that combination.
Here are some example Nix package URLs, including the Nix version, OS, and architecture:

- https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.18.1/nix-2.18.1-x86_64-linux.tar.xz
- https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.18.1/nix-2.18.1-aarch64-darwin.tar.xz

## Installation differences

Differing from the upstream [Nix][upstream-nix] installer scripts:

- In `nix.conf`:
  - the `nix-command` and `flakes` features are enabled
  - `bash-prompt-prefix` is set
  - `auto-optimise-store` is set to `true` (On Linux only)
  * `always-allow-substitutes` is set to `true`
  * `extra-nix-path` is set to `nixpkgs=flake:nixpkgs`
  * `max-jobs` is set to `auto`
  * `upgrade-nix-store-path-url` is set to `https://install.determinate.systems/nix-upgrade/stable/universal`, to prevent unintentional downgrades.
- an installation receipt (for uninstalling) is stored at `/nix/receipt.json` as well as a copy of the install binary at `/nix/nix-installer`
- `nix-channel --update` is not run, `~/.nix-channels` is not provisioned
- `ssl-cert-file` is set in `/etc/nix/nix.conf` if the `ssl-cert-file` argument is used.

## Installer settings

Determinate Nix Installer provides a variety of configuration settings, some [general](#general-settings) and some on a per-command basis.
All settings are available via flags or via `NIX_INSTALLER_*` environment variables.

### General settings

These settings are available for all commands.

You can also specify an installation receipt as the first argument (the default is `/nix/receipt.json`):

```shell
nix-installer uninstall /path/to/receipt.json
```

### Planning (`nix-installer plan`)

| Flag(s)      | Description                                        | Default (if any) | Environment variable          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--out-file` | Where to write the generated plan (in JSON format) | `/dev/stdout`    | `NIX_INSTALLER_PLAN_OUT_FILE` |

| `--no-confirm` | Run installation without requiring explicit user confirmation | `false`          | `NIX_INSTALLER_NO_CONFIRM` |

### Self-test (`nix-installer self-test`)

`nix-installer self-test` only takes [general settings](#general-settings).

## Diagnostics

The goal of Determinate Nix Installer is to successfully and correctly install Nix.
The `curl | sh` pipeline and the installer collects a little bit of anonymous diagnostic information to help us make that true.

The anonymous diagnostics we collect to help us improve the installer includes:

- The installer version
- Which planner is used (`linux`, `macos`, `steam-deck`)
- What action was taken (install, uninstall)
- The result (`Success`, `Failure`, `Pending`, or `Cancelled`)
- The customized planner setting names (_not_ the values)
- Information about your host, like the OS and version, architecture, binary format, etc.
- Whether you're in CI or not
- A high level description of what the failure was, like if a specific command failed.

To disable diagnostic reporting, set the diagnostics URL to an empty string by passing `--diagnostic-endpoint=""` or setting `NIX_INSTALLER_DIAGNOSTIC_ENDPOINT=""`.
